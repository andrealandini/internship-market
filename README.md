# jobscrapers

As I was wondering how one should keep up with the constant supply of job offers, I came to the realisation that I needed a way to systematically store the progress of the ongoing applications, instead of randomly apply and hope for the best. Hence, I wrote a "simple" scraper to keep me updated, trying to code as straightforwardly as I could. Of course, I am only starting to experiment the more advanced features of Python, I have considered the idea to implement metaclasses, but there was little to no reason to do so (at least for now). 

This is what I've done. Now, if there's something I hate, it's the programs lacking a proper explaination, so I want to specify, that you will need to add your details here:

```python

'''Insert Here Your Data'''

EMAIL='YOUR_EMAIL'
PASSWORD='YOUR_PASSWORD'
DIRECTORY='YOUR_OUTPUT_FOLDER'
CHROME_PATH='YOUR_CHROME_DRIVER_PATH'

```

For instance, I considered the output to be destinated in a separated folder, hence the "directory". Furthermore, I used chromedriver: I'm sure you could do better that as far as I'm concerned, you'll need to add your driver path.

This is a simply project so there's literally nothing more. Enjoy. 

P.S. there's a folder with some results that I've obtained.
