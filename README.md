# Analysis of Internship Job Applications: A Comparative Study of Graduateland, LinkedIn, Indeed, and Gjobs

This report presents the results of a research study conducted to analyze job application trends for entry-level internships on four prominent online platforms - Graduateland, LinkedIn, Indeed, and Gjobs. The primary objective was to gain insights into the application patterns of employers and identify any seasonal trends in internship postings. Data collected included the posting date, company name, and location for each application submitted. The research focused on understanding which platforms offered more internship opportunities and whether there were any discernible patterns in the posting frequency throughout the year.


To conduct this research, I applied for a range of entry-level internships across the four online platforms over a specified period. The data collected consisted of the application date, company name, and location for each internship opportunity. Only internships were considered to maintain a consistent focus on entry-level positions.

## Seasonal Trends:
A notable observation from the data was a clear increase in internship postings during July, indicating a trend of employers seeking interns for the upcoming quarter. This seasonal pattern may be attributed to the academic calendar, as many students graduate in the spring and seek internships for the summer or fall months.

## Conclusion:
Based on the data collected and analyzed from Graduateland, LinkedIn, Indeed, and Gjobs, it is evident that certain employers consistently have a higher number of internship vacancies, indicating their ongoing need for intern talent. Additionally, the significant increase in internship postings during July underscores a clear trend of employers hiring interns in preparation for the next quarter. Moreover, LinkedIn and Indeed appear to be more fruitful platforms for finding entry-level internships.
